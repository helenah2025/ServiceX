# Dunamis
Dunamis is a modular, database-driven IRC bot built with Python 3 and the Twisted library. With its plugin architecture, Dunamis can be easily extended to suit your needs.

Was originally called ServiceX, and developed as a pseudo-service for the DGS (Dead Gnome Society) IRC network, it was created to replace our Limnoria bot called X, which handled channel statistics and polling but had certain hardcoded limitations.

**Note:** The [original repository](https://github.com/DGS-Dead-Gnome-Society/ServiceX) is no longer maintained and contains outdated code.

**Please use this bot responsibly. Always obtain permission from channel owners before adding this bot to their channels.**
